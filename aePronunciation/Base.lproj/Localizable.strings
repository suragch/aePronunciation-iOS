"er_stressed_description" = "The /ɝ/ sound is sometimes written /ər/ or /əɹ/. This is the sound in a stressed syllable or a one-syllable word. When /ɝ/ is unstressed it is written /ɚ/. In British English /ɝ/ is pronounced as /ɜː/.";

"glottal_stop_description" = "This sound is called a glottal stop. It is not always taught in English textbooks, but it is an important part of American English pronunciation.

"flap_t_description" = "The /ɾ/ sound (not /r/) is called a flap t or an alveolar tap. It is not usually taught in English textbooks, but it is an important part of American English pronunciation. The /ɾ/ sound often replaces /t/, especially when /t/ comes between vowels in an unstressed syllable. The /ɾ/ sound can also be written /d/, though this is not as accurate. In that case, the examples would be written /\'wɑdɚ/, /\'lɪdəl/, ɑnd /\'θɝdi/.";
