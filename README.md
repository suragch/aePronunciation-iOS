iOS app for learning IPA and American English pronunciation

This app helps students learn to distinguish the various sounds of American English, which is the first step in being able to produce those sounds. Because it was made as a supplement to a college pronunciation course in northern China, the discriptions of common mispronunciations are more focused on this region of the world. However, most of the app content is suited to students of American English pronunciation no matter where they are from.

Students can learn, practice, and take tests on both individual sounds and double sounds. The double sounds, which consist of a consonant and a vowel, were added to help students differenciate sounds in context.
